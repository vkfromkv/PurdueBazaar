          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            At Purdue Bazaar, we understand the unique needs of our Mastodon
            community. Our journey began with a simple but powerful idea: to
            create a digital marketplace that empowers Purdue Fort Wayne
            students to engage with one another and find quality products from
            their fellow peers. Our founders, who are passionate about fostering
            a sense of unity and camaraderie on campus, envisioned a platform
            where Mastodons could come together to trade, buy, and sell items
            they need while supporting their peers' entrepreneurial endeavors.
          </p>
